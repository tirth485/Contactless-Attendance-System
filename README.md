## Inspiration:

Owing to the current(covid) situation it is essential to have a system, which has minimum contact, for attendance. Biometric attendance possesses the risk of spreading bacteria among its users. So in the pursuit of a solution, we came up with an idea of taking attendance with the help of a camera sensor. The current systems were capable of processing only one user's request at a time, which was very inefficient. Hence the inspiration came from the pursuit of a solution for no contact attendance system.
